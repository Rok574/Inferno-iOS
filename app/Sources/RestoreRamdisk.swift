/// The restore ramdisk, with our own two programs inside it.
///
/// After a restore writes the system, ChefKiss's guide has a person mount the
/// result on a Mac and run the filesystem patcher over the shared cache. That
/// step is the last one that needs a computer, and it does not have to: the
/// same patcher can run in the guest, in the same ramdisk boot, the moment the
/// restore is done writing. What it needs is to be in the ramdisk.
///
/// The ramdisk is an `IM4P` wrapping a raw HFSX volume, and adding a file to
/// HFS+ means inserting into its catalog B-tree -- splitting nodes, allocating
/// blocks, rewriting headers. Replacing the contents of a file that is already
/// there needs none of that: the catalog record stays where it is, the blocks
/// stay allocated to it, and all that changes are the bytes in those blocks and
/// two fields in the record. So this replaces three files the restore has no
/// use for:
///
/// - two NFC firmware blobs, megabytes each, for a secure element this machine
///   does not have;
/// - `com.apple.syslogd.plist`, a launchd job the ramdisk ships **disabled**,
///   which becomes the job that starts our daemon.
///
/// The plist needs one thing more. Nearly every file in the ramdisk is HFS+
/// compressed -- the contents live in an extended attribute and the data fork
/// is empty -- so there is nothing to overwrite. Clearing the compressed flag
/// and giving the record a block off the volume's own free list fixes that, and
/// is still only a matter of writing fields that are already there. The two
/// firmware blobs are among the handful of files stored plainly, and their
/// blocks are kept as they are.
///
/// Nothing is added, nothing is deleted, and the image keeps its exact size --
/// so the result goes back into the IM4P it came from without re-wrapping it.
