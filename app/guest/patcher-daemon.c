// The program that makes a restored system usable, run inside the guest.
//
// ChefKiss's guide ends with a computer: mount what the restore wrote and run
// the filesystem patcher over the shared cache. This is that step, done in the
// same ramdisk boot the restore itself runs in, so no computer is needed at
// all. The app puts this program and the patcher into the ramdisk (see
// RestoreRamdisk.swift) and launchd starts it at boot.
//
// Timing is everything here, and so is keeping still. Mounting the volumes
// while ASR still had them broke one restore; asking NVRAM every few seconds
// what the outcome was broke another, right as the restore was writing NOR.
//
// So this only reads a directory. The data volume is the last thing a restore
// makes -- it showed up nine minutes in, after everything else -- and by then
// the writing is over. The machine waits for us afterwards because the emulator
// is told to hold the reset the guest asks for.
